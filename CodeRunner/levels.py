# Below, you will see a function that has the player's x and y values as input, as well as info about each obstacle.

# 'info' is a list of tuples of the form (x, y, type), where x and y are coordinates and type is a string like "snail".

# The function should True if you wish to jump and False otherwise.

# Give this a shot!

# There are four types of obstacles, which you can distinguish based on their type: 'snail', 'fly', 'lion', and 'dragon'.
